# What is Vibe Conf'ing?

Before I recap my experience at posit::conf(2025), let's talk about "vibe conf'ing" *(Vibe Conf- Ing)*. I was first introduced to this term by [Ted Laderas](https://laderast.github.io):

![](images\origin.png){.blog-img fig-alt="Screenshot of social media conversation between Ted Laderas and Meghan Harris, MPH. Ted's post reads '100% support you for Vibe Conf'ing (not vibe coding)'. Meghan Harris replies 'Ted Laderas I am 100% committed to inserting the phrase 'Vibe Conf'ing' into the title of my conference recap blog post I hopefully will write after accrediting you. Thank you' with laughing and sparkle emojis."}

This came after I posted that I was going to posit::conf(2025) without participating in workshops, being a TA, or presenting talks. I couldn't understand why I struggled to just go "for the vibes" – attending without any expectation to "give something in return."

After some introspection, it clicked: I've never had the privilege to just go to a conference. No matter where I worked, I always HAD to get a talk accepted to afford the conference ticket that comes with it.

While submitting talks is cost-efficient, there's a hidden cost of stress and labor. Last year [I did a talk at posit::conf(2024)](https://thetidytrekker.com/talks/please_let_me_merge/please_let_me_merge) and promptly got covid for the first time immediately afterwards. As I isolated in my room, missing conf events and Tidy Dev Day, I promised myself I'd take "a break" next year.

Fast forward to this week: I actually listened to myself. I attended with no talks submitted, no expectations, just good vibes. I don't know if I'll submit next year (I have a backlog of ideas) or just vibe again. For now, let me dive into what this experience was like.

# What was posit::conf(2025) Like?

posit::conf(2025) was my 5th RStudio/Posit conference and 4th in-person. What I love about it is how chill and friendly it is. You don't have to dress up, worry about being socially awkward (I see you, fellow neurospicy peeps), or stress too much.

You can come and go as you please and choose how to consume keynotes and talks. Attend presentations live, watch from Posit's lounge outside the ballroom if crowds aren't your thing, or – though it seems counterintuitive – watch from your hotel room (I do this more than I care to admit). One of the best things about conf is the ability to tailor it to what you want and engage as much or as little as you'd like.

For first-timers or solo attendees, the organizers work hard to make everyone feel welcome. From Posit Discord invites to [encouraging the pac-man rule](https://masto.machlis.com/@smach/115219969813836800), the conference has earned its reputation for being newcomer-friendly.

<figcaption>From what I could see, a lot of us were actively following this rule</figcaption>

# My Personal Highlights
## Talk Sessions
As I've mentioned, Posit conf is really what you make it. This year, with no obligations, I felt "free to learn" for the first time. Having this freedom solidified something I'd been noticing: I'm increasingly drawn to the development side of data work.

I've found myself on a path that may be familiar to some data scientists. There's a subset of us who dip a toe into the "Development Pond" – maybe we need to build tools for data processing that dance on the edge of software engineering. Some pull their feet out once they've gotten what they needed, but others realize these skills could transform how we approach data problems entirely.

It's an exciting challenge: wanting to deepen these development skills while applying them to the work I already love. This year's conf was perfect for me because I was intentional about attending development-focused sessions that could enhance my current toolkit. Here are some talks that stood out:

## The Georgia Aquarium

This was hands-down the BEST social event in conf history (for me). I'm biased as I love water, but this event was great – and the food was surprisingly good. Posit rented out the Georgia Aquarium for us at night, and I had way more fun than expected. It gave me a chance to talk to people I hadn't run into at conf yet, and having the run of the place at night was honestly magical.

![](images/aquarium.png){.blog-img fig-alt="Three polaroid-style photos arranged in a scattered layout showing marine life: a circular aquarium tank with fish and coral from above, sharks swimming in blue water, and more sharks underwater with light streaming down."}

## Tidy Dev Day (TDD)
Ok y'all. I have a confession: this was my favorite thing about conf HANDS DOWN, even though it technically happened after. As I mentioned, I've been discovering I love development work, and Tidy Dev Day (TDD) gave me the PERFECT opportunity to explore this further in a low-stress, supportive environment.

The day started with an ice-breaker bingo sheet, then a group photo, followed by the Posit team explaining the workflow (forking/cloning/PRs, etc.) before turning us loose to work.

We could jump right in because the Posit team does reconnaissance beforehand, looking through [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), [r-lib](https://r-lib.r-universe.dev/packages), [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) issues good for beginners. They print snippets on post-it notes for the "issue wall" where participants choose what to work on. Once you open a PR, you get to ring "The Gong" – and if you open multiple PRs, you ring it multiple times:

![](images/gong.jpg){.blog-img fig-alt="Me smiling with ombre blue-tinted hair wearing a turquoise posit conf shirt and glasses, holding a mallet next to a large bronze gong mounted on a black metal stand. The setting is indoors with white curtains and wooden flooring in the background."}

<figcaption>My first time ringing "The Gong"</figcaption>

Before everyone really dove in, Hadley reassured everyone by saying something akin to:

> "I have written a lot of shitty code. It's OK if your code is shitty. We're here to learn."
>
> &mdash; Hadley Wickham

I have 7+ years of R programming under my belt, so while I'm confident tackling obscure problems, I admit when my code might be "shitty." One example? I constantly struggle to write concisely (my coworkers can confirm I'm anything but brief). Going into TDD, I tried cutting through brain noise to make my annotations and documentation short and sweet... only to be advised to add MORE info in places 😅. What I loved was how feedback was delivered – positive or clever contributions were celebrated and corrections came with grace and compassion. This gave me confidence to contribute to tidyverse packages more often, which I'm making a goal moving forward.

As the day progressed, I continued vibing and working, stopping only for provided snacks and lunch. Looking back, I was nervous beforehand about what skills I'd need to be "useful" to the tidyverse team. I can confidently say that basic GitHub functionality is enough, and if you lack that, they provide virtual "office hours" before TDD to get you ready. For direct function work, knowing how to debug is super helpful – Shannon Pileggi has workshops on this [here](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/workshops/2022-11-11-debugging).

By day's end, I opened 4 PRs with 2 accepted and merged so far for [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org), and [cli](https://cli.r-lib.org/index.html) – all packages I use frequently for my [artpack](https://github.com/Meghansaha/artpack) development.

# My Personal Takeaways
Needless to say, I had an awesome time and left with new discoveries and motivation to dig deeper into:

- Becoming a programming polyglot, focusing on Python and Rust in my downtime
- Using [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air) in my workflow
- Transitioning to Positron (this blog post was made in Positron!)
- Getting over my fear of contributing to open source packages
- Being less self-deprecating (TDD showed me that even if I struggle with brevity, I'm still intelligent. I may not know everything, but I know a lot, and that should be celebrated – even if just internally)

As for next year, posit::conf(2026) was announced for Houston, Texas. Not sure how I feel about traveling to Texas, but we'll see how things shake out. Until then, fellow nerds!
