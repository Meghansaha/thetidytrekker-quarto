## Description

> While you don't have to be an R expert to attend, some of the material expects that the viewer has a basic understanding of using the ggplot2 package and functional programming basics in R. This talk will go over the benefits of using functions from Base R and the Purrr package, different types of functions that can be created for generative art, and more. The workshop will end with a live coding rtistry session that viewers can follow along with. The code created in the live coding session will be available shortly after the session on GitHub.
