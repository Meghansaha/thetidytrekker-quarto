## Description

> R’s expansive capabilities can leave some feeling overwhelmed when tasked with larger projects like data pipelines.

Specifically, this talk will touch on the following concepts:

-   Surveying Data Landscapes
-   File Structures
-   Saving Yourself with Data Validation
-   Modularizing Code and Connecting R Scripts
-   Thinking about Pipeline Sustainability
-   Remaining Calm in Unfamiliar R Territories"
