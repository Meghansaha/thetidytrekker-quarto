## Description

> This talk will briefly introduce the concept of creating generative art in R (Rtistry) but then focus on a concept that seems to allude most: how to create the data required for generative art.
While knowledge of generative art is not required to attend, this talk does assume that attendees are comfortably familiar with the tidyverse, especially ggplot2. Attendees will learn some basic concepts involved in creating collages and patterns in ggplot2 by focusing on the logic required to generate randomized and non-randomized data sets for their rtistry! All scripts, slides, and talk materials will be available for use and review at the start of the talk.
