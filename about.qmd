<br><br>I\'m passionate about development quality, reproducible research, and building tools that make data work more reliable and accessible. My technical interests focus on package development, automated testing, data validation systems, and creating maintainable software.<br><br>I\'m the author of <a href="https://meghansaha.github.io/artpack">artpack</a> (available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/artpack/index.html">CRAN</a>, and I\'ve had the privilege of <a href = "https://thetidytrekker.com/talks">speaking publicly</a> on topics ranging from Git workflows to generative art to data pipelines. I\'m an advocate for open-source software, thorough testing practices, and thoughtful error messaging that helps users just focus on their goals.<br><br>
Currently, I\'m expanding my skills into Python package development and cross-language testing approaches. I use this platform to share my work, connect with the R and data science communities, and document my learning journey.
<br><br>When I\'m not coding, I love creating generative art (rtistry), playing video games, traveling, and spending time with my son, my husband, and my Patterdale terrier, Patches.</p>')))
